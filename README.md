## 💡 Project: Smart Home Energy Advisor

### Problem Statement

Homeowners often struggle to understand and optimize their energy usage. Manual tracking is time-consuming and lacks actionable insights, leading to higher costs and inefficient energy consumption.

### Solution Overview

The **Smart Home Energy Advisor** leverages AI to analyze household energy consumption patterns and provide personalized recommendations for efficiency. Using historical energy usage, weather data, and appliance profiles, the system predicts future usage trends and identifies cost-saving opportunities.
